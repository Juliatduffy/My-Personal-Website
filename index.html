                        <p> From 2024-2025 I helped run one of the largest
                            student groups on campus, with over 350 members. I
                            was one of the event managers and I was in charge of
                            all club communication (email, social media,
                            newsletter, website). I maintained a newsletter with
                            450 subscribers, and managed an instagram page with
                            more that
                            2,000 followers. I also organized many large events,
                            such as
                            a nationwide training camp
                            with USA Climbing, and several community-focused

                            I
                            worked as a freelance climbing

                            ambassador. Climbing is still one
                            of my biggest passions, but nowadays I
                            prefer
                            to climb outdoors. Climbing
                            competitively taught me about what it takes
                            to
                            achieve mastery in something, and it is
                            still one of my biggest passions outside of
                            software engineering.
