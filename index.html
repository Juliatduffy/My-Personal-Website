                    their shipping workflow by fixing rate calculations, simplifying 
                    how clothing orders are packaged, and opening up Canadian shipping. 
                    I also did general upkeep of the WordPress site and fixed a few bugs that I found. 
                    The changes I made reduced shipping losses by an estimated $7,400 per year, improved 
                    the overall feel of the website, 
                    and opened up the website to the Canadian market.</p>

                            student groups on campus, with over 350 members. I
                            was one of the event managers and I was in charge of
                            all club communication (email, social media,
                            newsletter, website). I maintained a newsletter with
                            450 subscribers, and managed an instagram page with
                            more that
                            2,000 followers. I also organized many large events,
                            such as
                            a nationwide training camp
                            with USA Climbing, and several community-focused
                            events with 100 attendees.</p>

                            Championship
                            competitor, 7x USA National team member, and
                            2x National Cup Champion. During this time,
                            I
                            worked as a freelance climbing
                            coach and brand
                            ambassador. Climbing is still one
                            of my biggest passions, but nowadays I
                            prefer
                            to climb outdoors. Climbing
                            competitively taught me about what it takes
                            to
                            achieve mastery in something, and it is
                            still one of my biggest passions outside of
                            software engineering.
