                            began by designing the database

                            practices. We used MySQL and a database server
                            on a remote machine provided by the School of
                            Computing at the university of Utah. Finally, we

                            which allowed us to display the functionality of
                            our database in a canvas-like web application.

                                This position has given me a deeper

                            <p>Pusher is an internationally recognized
                                climbing hold company. As an intern, I was
                                responsible for a number of
                                key improvements that directly impacted the
                                business's bottom line and workflow. By
                                implementing live shipping
                                rates at checkout to replace Pusher's
                                "flat rate" system where shipping was free
                                and factored into the price of products, I
                                successfully increased
                                profits on all products by 3-5%. I achieved
                                this by implementing a RESTful API called
                                "Shippo" to the site.
                                Additionally, I expanded the company's
                                global reach by introducing support for
                                international shipping and streamlined the
                                entire shipping process by automating label
                                printing and pickup scheduling. I also
                                enhanced the user
                                experience by improving the overall UI/UX
                                design of the website.

                                Sometimes helping run this team feels like
                                trying to run a small country, but it has
